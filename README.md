<h1>Simple API implemented using Golang</h1>

# Get Started

Make sure you have Golang and MongoDB both installed on your system.
Once you've insured these requirements are met, download or clone this repo on your own machine
and execute the following commands in order:

```
go install
```

<p>Clone the repository using the following URL</p>

```
https://github.com/Sumit-0311/goAPI
```

One this command is successfully executed, you're good to go!

To start the process, input the following command in terminal:

```
go run .
```

Once, you run this command, you install all the dependencies, and then you should get the following output.

```
Starting the application...
```

Now the API is running on your machine on the local port 12345, next lets move onto testing out newly
implemented API!
